/***************************************************
 
* This is a USART library for the ATMega328P.
 

*
 * It can provide basic USART (serial) communication for any application.
 

*
 * This code is in the public domain. Feel free to do with it whatever you want.
 

*
 *
 *
 * FOR STUDENTS:
 

*
 * This file will be given to you in an 'empty' state. The function bodies are
 
* provided, but not their content. You are supposed to add the proper code
 
* and complete these functions.
 

*
 * Hint 1: RTFM! The Atmel device datasheets contain all information necessary.
 

*
 * Hint 2: We do not expect you to write the most performant or exceptionally
 
* well-engineered code, but it should work. If in doubt, sacrifice speed for
 
* reliability. If you are bored, rewrite the entire library in assembler and
 
* squeeze the last microsecond out of it.
